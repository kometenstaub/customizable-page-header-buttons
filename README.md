# Customizable Page Header Obsidian Plugin

This plugin lets you add buttons that execute commands to the top bar in the mobile (and desktop, off by default) app.

It lets you choose from all commands and configure their icons. You can set icons from the core and feather icons.

## Credits

Shoutout to [@phibr0](https://github.com/phibr0) for his awesome work on the [Customizable Sidebar Plugin](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-customizable-sidebar). The code that powers this plugins' settings (adding/removing commands/changing icons) is powered by an adapted version of his code.

Also thank you to [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#quick-start) and the [Obsidian Community Lib](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-community-lib) on which this plugin relies.
